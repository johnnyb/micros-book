\chapter*{About the Author}

Most author biographies attempt to paint the author as an expert in 
the subjects they are writing on.  I write this book, however, not
as a specialist, but as someone who has looked up from the daily grind
to see where society is going, and decided that it might be better to 
go somewhere else.  

My vocation is software development, but my avocation is doing my part
to fix the world, whether it is praying, raising children, writing, research,
theology, science, advocacy, or just doing my day job well.

My wife and I have had five children---three living, and two who we lost
to a rare genetic disease.  We homeschool our children, and are involved
with the Classical Conversations homeschool education community.

If you are interested in reading more of my work, you should check out
the book's website, microsecession.com, which has links to my other
writing, including my monthly science, faith, and homeschooling column 
for the Classical Conversations Writer's Circle.

If you are a computer
programmer, you might be interested in my previous book,
\textit{Programming from the Group Up: An Introduction to Programming
Using Linux Assembly Language}, which has been used at a wide range
of institutions, including Princeton University, Oklahoma State University, 
and DeVry University.
