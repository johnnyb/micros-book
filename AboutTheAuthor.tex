\chapter*{About the Author}

Jonathan Bartlett is a person.  First and foremost, I write this book not
as a specialist, but as someone who has looked up to see where society is 
going, and decided that it might be better to go somewhere else.  

My vocation is software development, but my avocation is doing my part
to fix the world, whether it is praying, raising children, writing, research,
theology, science, advocacy, or just doing my day job well.

My wife and I have had five children---three living, and two who we lost
to a rare genetic disease.  We homeschool our children, and are involved
with the Classical Conversations homeschool education community.

If you are interested in reading more of my work, you should check out
the book's website, microsecession.com, which has links to my other
writing, including my monthly science, faith, and homeschooling column 
for the Classical Conversations Writer's Circle.
